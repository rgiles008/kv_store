# What could be done differently

- Instead of using a list for my store I could've implented a GenServer to pass and hold the state through each interaction
- I could've written some test coverage for the functions
- I could've handled more edge cases with user input. I assumed successful input and covered some negatives
- I could've organized code in a different way so things dont repeat as often
- I could've provided responses on each step so the user can know what the store looks like at each step
